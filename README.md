# IronMaster
A small command-line tool written using Kotlin to player run a solo [Ironsworn RPG](http://www.ironswornrpg.com) game.

 This tool is for the beginners who do not have to spend time on setup or try the game with minimum arrangements and configurations. We also plan to make it easy to guide. But its for the long run. Currently goal fo this game is to minimize the setup and fast way to handle the system. 

This tool is a command-line tool. You have to open in your command prompt/terminal, and you will be in a shell. Just by typing, you interact with the tool.
